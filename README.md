## Introducing


This game was wrote on Global Games Jam Minsk 2015. Where you have 48 hours for make new game. 
It's my firstt ime on hackaton and I had solo coding on new for me game framework [Phaser.js](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser). 

I decided write parody game on film Gravity. But in my game main hero is Yorshik (eng. `brush`) Clooney. Who must to save Bullochka (eng. `bun`) Bullock. 

It's simple 2D platformer where you can change gravity (UP/DOWN). For complete level player must collect all coins on stage.

You can play [here](http://ar0ne.github.io/ggjm2015_gravity/Gravity/).

**Warning**: I think it's my indusest code ever! Don't show it ... anybody! ãƒ„
